# ðŸ§  Customer Churn Prediction using Olist E-Commerce Data

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in an e-commerce context using real-world transactional data from **Olist**, a major Brazilian online marketplace. It involves data cleaning, churn definition, feature engineering, model building, and performance visualization â€” all aimed at identifying which customers are likely to stop purchasing and how we can retain them.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset

**Source**: [Kaggle - Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)

The dataset includes:
- Orders, customers, payments, sellers, products, and reviews data
- Customer-level transactional behavior over time

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Define customer churn using behavioral data (e.g. recent inactivity)
- Explore patterns that separate churned vs. active customers
- Build classification models to predict churn
- Generate business recommendations for reducing churn

---

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Cleaning & Processing** (`pandas`, `datetime`, `missing values`)
- **Churn Label Creation** (custom logic based on last purchase date)
- **Feature Engineering** (recency, frequency, payment totals, etc.)
- **Modeling** (`Logistic Regression`, `Random Forest`, `train/test split`)
- **Evaluation Metrics** (`accuracy`, `precision`, `recall`, `F1`, `confusion matrix`)
- **Data Visualization** (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`, heatmaps)
