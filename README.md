# ðŸ§  Customer Churn Prediction using Olist E-Commerce Data

This project aims to predict customer churn for an e-commerce business using the Olist dataset (Brazil). We use transaction, payment, and customer behavior data to identify churn risk and provide business recommendations.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset

**Source**: [Kaggle - Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)

- Orders, customers, payments, and product data from a large e-commerce platform in Brazil
- Used to build insights and predict customer churn

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Define customer churn using behavioral data
- Analyze patterns between churned and retained customers
- Build a model to predict future churn
- Provide actionable business strategies for retention

---

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Cleaning & Processing** (pandas, datetime handling)
- **Exploratory Data Analysis** (matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Feature Engineering for Churn**
- **Classification Models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- **Evaluation Metrics** (Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC)
